# Framez
something small to create abstract artworks(not sure about this one) based on your movies files.
provide the path to your movie file (.mkv, .mp4, anything) and recieve a collage of the frames in the movie. an example:
--> /path/to/file/2001ASpaceOdyssey.mkv

The default frame rate is one image per **5** frames, you can simply change it.

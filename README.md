# Framez
Something small to create abstract artworks (not sure about this one) based on your movies files.

Provide the path to your movie file (.mkv, .mp4, anything) and recieve a collage of the frames in the movie. an example:

### Example

> /path/to/file/2001ASpaceOdyssey.mkv

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdead263/framez/master/images/2001_A_Space_Odyssey_1968.jpg)

You can find the other examples in `/images` directory.

The default frame rate is one image per **5** frames, you can simply change it.
remember to do `pip3 install requirements.txt`

##### Currently works on gnu/linux+python3 only.

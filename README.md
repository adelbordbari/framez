# Framez
Something small to create abstract artworks (not sure about this one) based on your movies files.

Provide the path to your movie file (.mkv, .mp4, anything) and recieve a collage of the frames in the movie. an example:

### Example

> /path/to/file/2001ASpaceOdyssey.mkv

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackdead263/framez/master/2001_A_Space_Odyssey.jpg)

The default frame rate is one image per **5** frames, you can simply change it.

##### Currently works on gnu/linux only
